# Number-Guessing-game-in-C
The Number Guessing Game in C lets the computer pick a random number, and the player guesses it. After each guess, hints like “too high” or “too low” are shown until the correct number is found. It uses loops, conditionals, variables, and rand() to teach basic C programming concepts interactively.
